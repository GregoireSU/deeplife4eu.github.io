## Program


<br>

**Note that jounral clubs will start at 5pm sharp; from 4.30pm until 5.30pm, on Thuesdays**


The journal club sessions will be **60-minute and online**. They will be animated by [teachers]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/team) from all participating universities. Four groups will participate in each session:

1. **Background team**: the groupe will explain the context and background of the paper.

2.**Presenter team**: the group that will present the paper.

3.**Reviewer team**: the group that will act as reviewers and ask questions. Please send your question **2 days** before the journal club so they can be shared to other groups.

4.**Writer team**: the group that will write a 2-page summary of the paper and the session, with up to 10 references.

### Prerequisites {#Prerequisites}


Students attending this course are expected to have some basic statistics knowledge and machine-learning fundamentals. 
You can use the lecture material from last year's edition, in particular the four introductory lectures:

Recommended books are among others:

1. [Deep Learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville
2. [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf) by Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman
3. [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) by Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman (a simpler version of the previous book)
4. [Machine learning with PyTorch and scikit-learn](https://www.packtpub.com/product/machine-learning-with-pytorch-and-scikit-learn/9781801819312) by Raschka, Liu, Mirjalili (a great introduction into the technical aspects of DL in pyTorch).

As the practical sessions will be mostly based on Python and pyTorch, some basic knowledge in python is required (see reference [4] for a good overview of pyTorch for example).

Specifically, we expect that the following theoretical concepts are familiar:

#### basic statistics 

* accuracy
* sensitivity/specificity
* area under the curve (AUC)
* probability distributions
* random variable
* expectation of a random variable

#### machine-learning

* overfitting vs. underfitting
* cross-validation
* usage of training, validation and testing datasets
* classification vs. regression (supervised vs. unsupervised)
* binary vs. multi-class classification
* standard ML algorithms such as Random Forest

#### mathematical foundations

* matrix algebra


### Preliminary schedule of lectures

[Link to the weekly Zoom lecture](https://eu02web.zoom-x.de/j/68946797163) **(Note: you will get the passphrase to join the meeting from your local instructor!)**

**Note that lectures start at 5pm; from 4.30 until 5pm, there will be a short debrief of the exercise sheet of the previous week!**
